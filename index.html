Hi, I'm Paul. I'm a french-german nerd who loves the techy stuff. I've been wheeling and dealing in software for most of my conscious life. I lived in Brooklyn, NY for a while where I was working as Livestream's Chief Architect.
I now reside in Berlin, Germany where I freelance. I enjoy traveling and have just accomplished a motorcycle travel trip which took me 25,000 miles from New York to Buenos Aires.
