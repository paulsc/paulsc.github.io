<p>Hi, I'm Paul. </p>
<p>I'm a french-german nerd who loves the techy stuff. I've been wheeling and dealing in software for most of my conscious life. I lived in Brooklyn, NY for a while where I was working at Livestream.</p>
<p>
<p>I now reside in Berlin, Germany where I am a freelance developer. I enjoy traveling and have just accomplished a motorcycle travel trip which took me 25,000 miles from New York to Buenos Aires.</p>

<br/></br/><br/>

<p>Here's some of the stuff I worked/am working on:</p>
<p><a href="http://livestream.com" alt="livestream">Livestream</a> - I lived in Brooklyn, NY and worked at Livestream for five years. The last position I held was Chief Architect.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.getyuppie.com" alt="yuppie">Yuppie</a> - I'm building yuppie's backend in ruby on rails.  </p> 
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/105955686" alt="resonate">Resonate</a> - Experimenting with ways to include the audience more in a DJ set / music / show.
